# CS329 Homework 1
Here we are collecting a set of tools to make it easier to evaluate test-time compute techniques.

## Setup

```bash
1. Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/ and install
2. Create a new environment, and install the repo:

```bash
conda create -n cs329a-hw1 python=3.10 -y
conda activate cs329a-hw1
pip install -e .  # Run this from root of the repo.
```

The starter code is in `homework1.ipynb`.

Make sure you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.
